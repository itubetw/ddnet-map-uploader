# ddnet-map-uploader
a simple python script which is used to upload a map from discord to your server in the game ddnet/teeworlds

How to use:

1) change (line 7) ``save_path = '/home/itube/ddnet/build/data/maps/'`` to your own path.

2) change (line 15) ``bot.run('your-token')`` to your bot token.

That's it! Now you can use ``!save_file`` and put the map in the same message to upload it :)

(THE UPLOADER NEEDS THE ROLE 'Mapper' TO UPLOAD MAPS)
